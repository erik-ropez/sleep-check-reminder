<b>About</b>
<br/>
<br/>
This application will help you to build a habit of reminding yourself to check if you are sleeping or not.
With such habit in place one can remember to make a check while sleeping and realize that he or she is sleeping. By doing so one can increase chances of falling into <b>lucid dreaming</b>.
<br/>
<br/>
Application provides collection of great tips about reality checks and <b>lucid dreams</b> in general, check them out by using <b>Next Tip</b> button.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using <b>random</b> length time periods prevents you from being prepared for notification. Use <b>fixed</b> length time periods to follow your rhythm of sleep.
<br/>
<br/>    
<b>Background sound</b> is useful to remind you thru dream without waking you up. Choose sound which suits you and adjust <b>volume</b> so that you don\'t wake up. You can use it also during a day to create <b>sub-conscious connection</b> between specific sound and intention.

		<item>Some people who learn lucid dreaming decide to write a capital "L" for Lucid on the back of their hand, which reminds them.</item>

		<item>When you write, it may be illegible or irregular, and the letters may change.</item>
